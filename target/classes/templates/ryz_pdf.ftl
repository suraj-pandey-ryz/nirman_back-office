                    significant aspects of trading. You should, therefore, study
                    derivatives trading carefully before becoming involved in it
                    <br />
                    In the light of the risks involved, you should undertake
                    transactions only if you understand the nature of the contractual

                    derivatives contracts or other instruments traded on the Stock
                    Exchange(s), which have varying element of risk, is generally not an
                    appropriate avenue for someone of limited resources/ limited
                    investment and/ or trading experience and low risk tolerance. You

                    In considering whether to trade, you should be aware of or must get
                    acquainted with the following:-<br />
                    <b>1. Basic Risks</b><br />
                    <b>i. Risk of Higher Volatility</b><br />
                    a. Volatility refers to the dynamic changes in price that
                    security/derivatives contracts undergo when trading activity
                    continues on the Stock Exchange. Generally, higher the volatility of
                    a securities/derivatives contract, greater is its price swings.
                    There may be normally greater volatility in thinly traded security/
                    derivatives contracts than in actively traded security/derivatives
                    contracts. As a result of volatility, your order may only be
                    partially executed or not executed at all, or the price at which
                    your order got executed may be substantially different from the last
                    traded price or change substantially thereafter, resulting in real
                    losses
                    <br />
                    <b>ii. Risk of Lower Liquidity</b>
                    <br />
                    a.. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy
                    and/ or sell security/ derivative contract expeditiously at a
                    competitive price and with minimal price difference. Generally, it
                    is assumed that more the number of orders available in a market,
                    greater is the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with
                    greater liquidity, it is easier for investors to buy and/ or sell
                    security/ derivatives contracts swiftly and with minimal price
                    difference and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or
                    receive a competitive price for security/ derivative contracts
                    purchased or sold. There may be a risk of lower liquidity in some
                    security/ derivative contracts as compared to active security/
                    derivative contracts. As a result, your order may only be partially
                    executed, or may be executed with relatively greater price
                    difference or may not be execute at all. b. Buying/ Selling without
                    intention of giving and/ or taking delivery of certain
                    securities may also result into losses, because in such a situation,
                    security / derivative contracts may have to be squared-off at a low/
                    high prices, compared to the expected price levels, so as not to
                    have any obligation to deliver/ receive such security / derivative
                    contracts
                    <br />
                    <b>iii. Risk of Wider Spreads</b>
                    <br />
                    a. Spread refers to the difference in best buy price and best sell
                    price. It represents the differential between the price of buying a
                    security/ derivative contracts and immediately selling it or vice
                    versa. Lower liquidity and higher volatility may result in wider
                    than normal spreads for less liquid or illiquid security/derivatives
                    contracts. This in turn will hamper better price formation.

                <p>
                    <b>iv. Risk-reducing orders</b><br />
                    a. Most of the Exchanges have a facility for investors to place
                    “limit orders”, “stop loss orders” etc. Placing of such orders (e.g.
                    “stop loss” orders or “limit” orders) which are intended to limit
                    losses to certain amounts may not be effective many a time because
                    rapid movement in market conditions may make it impossible to
                    execute such orders.<br />
                    b. A “market” order will be executed promptly, subject to
                    availability of orders on opposite side, without regard to price and
                    that while the customer may receive a prompt execution of a “market”
                    order, the execution may be at available prices of outstanding
                    orders, which satisfy the order quantity, on price time priority. It
                    may be understood that these prices may be significantly different
                    from the last traded price or the best price in that security/
                    derivatives contract.<br />
                    c. A “limit” order will be executed only at the “limit” price
                    specified for the order or a better price. However, while the client
                    received price protection, there is a possibility that the order may
                    not be executed at all.<br />
                    d. Astop loss order is generally placed “away” from the current
                    price of a stock / derivatives contract, and such order gets
                    activated if and when the contract reaches, or trades through, the
                    stop price. Sell stop orders are entered ordinarily below the
                    current price, and buy stop orders are entered ordinarily above the
                    current price. When the contract approaches pre-determined price, or
                    trades through such price, the stop loss order converts to a
                    market/limit order and is executed at the limit or better. There is
                    no assurance therefore that the limit order will be executable since
                    a contract might penetrate the predetermined price, in which case,
                    the risk of such order not getting executed arises, just as with a
                    regular limit order.<br />
                    <b>v. Risk of News Announcements</b><br />
                    a. Traders/Manufacturers make news announcements that may impact the
                    price of the stock/ derivatives contracts. These announcements may
                    occur during trading and when combined with lower liquidity and
                    higher volatility may suddenly cause an unexpected positive or
                    negative movement in the price of the security/ derivatives
                    contract.<br />
                    <b>vi. Risk of Rumours</b><br />
                    a. Rumours about companies/currencies at times float in the market
                    through word of mouth, newspaper, websites or news agencies, etc.,
                    the investors should be wary of and should desist from acting on
                    rumours.<br />
                    <b> vii. System Risk</b><br />
                    a. High volume trading will frequently occur at the market opening
                    and before market close. Such high volumes may also occur at any
                    point in the day. These may cause delays in order execution or
                    confirmation.
                </p>
            </td>
            <td style="width: 50%">
                <p>
                    b. During periods of volatility, on account of market participants
                    continuously modifying their order quantity or prices or placing
                    fresh orders, there may be delays in execution of order and its
                    confirmation.<br />
                    c. Under certain market conditions, it may be difficult or
                    impossible to liquidate a position in the market at a reasonable
                    price or at all, when there are no outstanding orders either on the
                    buy side or the sell side, or if trading is halted in a
                    security/derivatives contract due to any action on account of
                    unusual trading activity or price hitting circuit filters or for any
                    other reason.<br />
                    <b>viii.System/ Network Congestion </b><br />
                    a. Trading on the Exchange is in electronic mode, based on
                    satellite/leased line communications, combination of technologies
                    and computer systems to place and route orders. Thus, there exists a
                    possibility of communication failure or system problems or slow or
                    delayed response from system or trading halt, or any such other
                    problem/glitch whereby not being able to establish access to the
                    trading system/network, which may be beyond the control of and may
                    result in delay in processing or not processing buy or sell orders
                    either in part or in full. You are cautioned to note that although
                    these problems may be temporary in nature, but when you have
                    outstanding open positions or unexecuted orders, these represent a
                    risk because of your obligations to settle all executed
                    transactions.<br />
                    <b>2. As far as Derivatives are concerned, please note and get
                        yourself acquainted with the following additional features:-<br />Effect
                        of “Leverage” or “Gearing”: </b><br />
                    a. The amount of margin is small relative to the value of the
                    derivatives contract so the transactions are ‘leveraged’ or
                    ‘geared’. Derivatives trading, which is conducted with a relatively
                    small amount of margin, provides the possibility of great profit or
                    loss in comparison with the principal investment amount. But
                    transactions in derivatives carry a high degree of risk. You should
                    therefore completely understand the following statements before
                    actually trading in derivatives contracts and also trade with
                    caution while taking into account one’s circumstances, financial
                    resources, etc<br />
                    b. Trading in Futures Derivatives involves daily settlement of all
                    positions. Every day the open positions are marked to market based
                    on the closing price. If the closing price has moved against you,
                    you will be required to deposit the amount of loss (notional)
                    resulting from such movement. This margin will have to be paid
                    within a stipulated time frame, generally before commencement of
                    trading on the next day.

                    d. Under certain market conditions, an Investor may find it
                    difficult or impossible to execute the transactions. For example,
                    this situation can occur due to factors such as liquidity i.e. when
                    there are insufficient bids or offers or suspension of trading due
                    to price limit or circuit breakers etc.<br />
                    e. Steps, such as, changes in the margin rate, increase in the cash
                    margin rate etc. may be adopted in order to maintain market
                    stability. These new measures may be applied to the existing open
                    interests. In such conditions, you will be required to put up
                    additional margins or reduce your positions.<br />
                    f. You must ask your Member of the Exchange to provide the full
                    details of the securities / derivatives
                    contracts you plan to trade i.e. the contract specifications and the
                    associated obligations.<br />

                    You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded to the
                    money or other property you deposit particularly in the event of a
                    firm become insolvent or bankrupt. The extent to which you may
                    recover your money or property may be governed by specific
                    legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property, which
                    has been specifically identifiable as your own, will be prorated in
                    the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution in the event of
                    a shortfall. In case of any dispute with the Member of the Exchange,
                    the same shall be subject to arbitration as per the Rules, Bye-laws
                    and Business Rules of the Exchange.<br />
                    ii. Commission and other charges:<br />
                    Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of
                    all commissions, fees and other charges for which you will be
                    liable. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or

                    <b>Risk of Option holders:</b> <br />
                    1. An option holder runs the risk of losing the entire amount paid
                    for the option in a relatively short period of time. This risk
                    reflects the nature of an option as a wasting asset which becomes
                    worthless when it expires. An option holder who neither sells his
                    option in the secondary market nor exercises it prior to its
                    expiration will necessarily lose his entire investment in the
                    option. If the price of the underlying does not change in the
                    anticipated direction before the option expires, to an extent
                    sufficient to cover the cost of the option, the investor may lose
                    all or a significant part of his investment in the option.<br />
                    2. The Exchanges may impose exercise restrictions and have absolute
                    authority to restrict the exercise of options at certain times in
                    specified circumstances.<br />
                    <b>Risks of Option Writers:</b><br />
                    1. If the price movement of the underlying is not in the anticipated
                    direction, the option writer runs the risks of losing substantial
                    amount.<br />
                    2. The risk of being an option writer may be reduced by the purchase
                    of other options on the same underlying interest and<br />
                </p>
            </td>
            <td style="width: 50%">
                <p>
                    thereby assuming a spread position or by acquiring other types of
                    hedging positions in the options markets or other markets. However,
                    even where the writer has assumed a spread or other hedging
                    position, the risks may still be significant. A spread position is
                    not necessarily less risky than a simple 'long' or 'short'
                    position.<br />
                    3. Transactions that involve buying and writing multiple options in
                    combination, or buying or writing options in combination with buying
                    or selling short the underlying interests, present additional risks
                    to investors. Combination transactions, such as option spreads, are
                    more complex than buying or writing a single option. And it should
                    be further noted that, as in any area of investing, a complexity not
                    well understood is, in itself, a risk factor. While this is not to
                    suggest that combination strategies should not be considered, it is
                    advisable, as is the case with all investments in options, to
                    consult with someone who is experienced and knowledgeable with
                    respect to the risks and potential rewards of combination
                    transactions under various market circumstances.<br />

                    a. An
                    unfair term of a non-negotiated contract will be void.<br />
                    b. Aterm is
                    unfair if it –<br />
                    i. causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of
                    the parties under the financial contract, to the detriment of the
                    Client; and<br />
                    ii. is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests
                    of the Member.<br />
                    c. The factors to be taken into account while determining whether a
                    term is unfair, include –<br />
                    i. the nature of the financial product or financial service dealt
                    with under the financial contract;<br />
                    ii. the extent of transparency of the term; **contracts offered by
                    Sebi and stock exchange<br />
                    iii. the extent to which the term allows a Client to compare it with
                    other financial contracts for similar financial products or
                    financial services; and<br />
                    iv. the financial contract as a whole and the terms of any other
                    contract on which it is dependent.<br />
                    d. Aterm is transparent if it –<br />
                    i. is expressed in reasonably plain language that is likely to be
                    understood by the Client;<br />
                    ii. is legible and presented clearly; and<br />
                    iii. is readily available to the Client affected by the term. e. If
                    a term of a financial contract is determined to be unfair under
                    point 11.A.c, the parties will continue to be bound by the remaining
                    terms of the financial contract to the extent that the financial
                    contract is capable of enforcement without the unfair term.<br />
                    11. B.<br />
                    a. “Non-negotiated contract” means a contract whose terms, other
                    than the terms contained in point 11.C. (given below) are not
                    negotiated between the parties to the financial contract and
                    includes –<br />

                    has a substantially greater bargaining power in determining terms of
                    the financial contract; and<br />
                    ii. a standard form contract.<br />
                    b. “Standard form contract” means a financial contract that is
                    substantially not negotiable for the Client, except for the terms
                    contained in point 11.C
